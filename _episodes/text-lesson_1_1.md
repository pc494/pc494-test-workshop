title: "Prereg: Introducing the concept - the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of preregistration"
teaching: 15
exercises: 15
duration: null
summary: An introduction to what preregistration entails, the benefits of
  preregistration, and discussion of any concerns.
questions:
  - What is a preregistration?
  - What are the benefits of preregistration?
  - What concerns do people have about preregistration? How can we mitigate them?
objectives:
  - Understand what preregistration entails
  - Understand the benefits of preregistration
  - Understand common concerns and how to mitigate them
keypoints:
  - A preregistration is a specification of your research plan, written in
    advance on conducting the research
  - Preregistration benefits science and researchers by making your research
    more transparent
  - Researchers have several concerns surrounding preregistration, but many of
    them can be solved

## Introduction and discussion
Introduce the concept of preregistration, and why it is important in your discipline. It can be useful to add a discussion element to your workshop to gauge participants' understanding of preregistration.

> ## Discussion
> You may want to start by introducing the problems that preregistration solves, e.g.:
> - P-hacking (analysing data in different ways in order to better support a particular hypothesis)
> - HARKing (hypothesising after results are known, i.e. changing hypotheses to fit the data)
> - Under-specified protocols / high ‘researcher degrees of freedom’
> - Duplication of efforts
> - Competition/scooping - lack of a timestamped claim to a protocol
> - Etc.
{: .discussion}

Then, explain the mechanics of how preregistration works (timestamped, frozen document detailing protocol, prior to study)

Finally, if applicable, discuss the differences between preregistration and RRs

## Benefits of preregistration 

> ## Discussion
> Introduce some of the benefits of preregistering your research. These could include:
> - Explaining how preregistration addresses the problems above
> - Outlining the selfish reasons to preregister, for example:
> - Improves credibility (among reviewers and readers)
> - Can help improve study quality, by planning ahead and anticipating problems
> - Makes the eventual study easier to run, as it’s pre-planned
> - Helps keep the study accountable to its original aims 
> - Etc.

## Acknowledging and addressing concerns
Importantly, address the concerns that your participants have. Some concerns may not have solutions, and simply need to be acknowledged; however, many can be resolved. Common concerns may include:

> ## Concern 1
> Preregistration prohibits exploratory analysis
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistration is a plan, not a prison - exploratory analyses are fine, as long as they are labeled as such
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 2
> What if I make a mistake or have an oversight?
> > ## Solution
> > Changes to the preregistered plan are fine, they just need to be reported transparently
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 3
> Is preregistration suitable for non-experimental research?
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistration may be less useful, but still can help in transparently defining aims and methods beforehand. There are prereg templates for many of these, including:
> > - Qualitative research 
> > - Exploratory studies or disciplines, e.g. high throughput drug discovery 
> > - Secondary data analysis or simulated data
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 4
> Preregistration creates extra work
> > ## Solution
> > Yes, preregistration takes extra time at the start of a study, but can save time in writing up the paper, and hopefully benefits are worth the extra effort
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 5
> If I preregister my research I might get scooped
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistrations can be embargoed until the study is complete
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

You may want to invite participants to share any other concerns they have, and discuss these as a group. But be careful not to get bogged down in overly philosophical or theoretical discussions - the point of the workshop is to make practical changes!
- Set only a certain amount of time for discussion, and make sure to move on afterward
- Offer to discuss lingering concerns with attendees after the workshop
- Remember, you don’t need to dispel all concerns - it’s ok to say you don’t know (but will look it up), or just acknowledge there are some risks/drawbacks
