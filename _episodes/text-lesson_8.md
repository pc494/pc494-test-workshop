Teach participants about the process of submitting and publishing a RR, including examples of policies from journals in your field when relevant. You might frame this by talking an example of a RR that you or a colleague submitted. 

# Where to submit a RR
- Find an existing RR journal (cos.io/rr - ‘participating journals’ tab)
- You can request a journal to offer RR format - template letter on cos.io/rr
- Peer Community In Registered Reports (PCI RR) offers a ‘pool’ format where peer review comes before journal submission

# Understanding the review process - offer any tips for navigating RR review
**Stage 1**	
- You may have to push back against reviewers if proposed changes are not feasible or reviewers are too pushy - seek the editor’s help
- Consider when to apply for ethics review, if necessary - if the ethics board is very strict with changes or slow with amendments, this may need to wait until after Stage 1 acceptance. Discuss with the journal editor if necessary

**Stage 2**
- Remember that reviewers cannot raise new objections to the study at this time, except if it deviates from the Stage 1 plan

## Handling changes/mistakes when running the study
- Discuss these with the editor before making changes, if possible
- Report changes or mistakes to the editor as soon as they arise - they can help you problem-solve
