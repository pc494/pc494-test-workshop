Take participants through the steps of how to write a RR, referring to this [checklist](https://osf.io/93znh/), [practical recommendations](https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(19)30124-9) or [other resources](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports) as necessary.

## Make sure your study is suitable as a RR
The RR should ideally have a well-defined research question that will be informative no matter the results (i.e., not only interesting if the hypothesis is confirmed).

The study should include positive controls and/or manipulation checks, to ensure that potential null results do not merely reflect ineffective study design.

## Identify possible journals
See lists of those that offer RRs (see: cos.io/rr), or write to an editor to ask them to offer (many will be amenable!).
- Some journals publish Stage 1 protocols when they are in-principle accepted, as a separate publication to Stage 2 results; others publish both stages together at the end
- Some journals publish reviews - check if you have a preference

## Look up the RR template or guidance for your preferred journal
It may be useful to go through this with participants using a relevant journal in your field, but most RRs will require:
- A full introduction with literature review, background and research question. This introduction section cannot be updated after the study is run
- A comprehensive methods section specifying every detail of the methods, sufficient for others to reproduce the study
- An analysis plan 
- For quantitative RRs: must be specific enough to restrict each analysis to one single path (no hidden flexible options)

It may help to check guidelines and common challenges related to reviewing a RR, so authors know what reviewers will look for.

Remember that usually, the accepted Stage 1 manuscript cannot be changed after in-principle acceptance - so ensure it is in publishable shape before finalizing!
