teaching: 15
exercises: 15
duration: null
summary: ""
questions:
  - What is a Registered Report?
  - What are the benefits of Registered Reports?
  - What concerns do people have about Registered Reports? How can we mitigate
    them?
objectives:
  - Understand what Registered Reports entails
  - Understand the benefits of Registered Reports
  - Understand common concerns and how to mitigate them
keypoints:
  - A Registered Report is a type of journal article presenting a peer-reviewed
    pre-registration of proposed methods and analysis plans
  - Registered Reports benefits science and researchers by making research more
    transparent
  - Researchers have several concerns surrounding Registered Reports, but many
    of them can be solved

## Introduction and discussion
Introduce the concept of RRs, and why it is important in your discipline. (see example talks at https://osf.io/d4fh5/)
- Explain how RRs differ from normal publications
- If applicable, discuss the differences between preregistration and RRs

## Benefits of preregistration 

> ## Discussion
> Introduce the benefits of RRs in your field, including some selfish reasons. For example:
> - Guarantees that study can be published regardless of the results
> - Helps improve the study by having peer review before it is run
> - Eliminates the need to submit to multiple journals after the study is complete
> - Improves credibility of results
> - Etc.
{: .discussion}

## Acknowledging and addressing concerns
Importantly, address the concerns that your participants have. Some concerns may not have solutions, and simply need to be acknowledged; however, many can be resolved. Common concerns may include:

> ## Concern 1
> Having the peer review process at the beginning takes extra time to get started
> > ## Solution
> > Yes, but this process improves the study quality and guarantees a publication at the end--so well worth it
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 2
> Registered Reports stifles creativity and prohibits exploratory analyses
> > ## Solution
> > Exploratory analyses can still be included, and lack of ‘creativity’ in interpreting results may actually be a benefit of credibility!
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 3
> Registered Reports may not be suitable for me type of research
> > ## Solution
> > Registered Reports may be less useful, but still can help in transparently defining aims and methods beforehand. There are examples for many of these, including:
> > - Qualitative research 
> > - Exploratory studies or disciplines, e.g. high throughput drug discovery 
> > - Secondary data analysis or simulated data
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Concern 4
> If I write a Registered report my research I might get scooped
> > ## Solution
> > The Stage 1 RR can be embargoed until the full manuscript is published -- but, admittedly, you cannot guarantee that editors/reviewers won’t scoop the idea
> {: .solution}

You may want to invite participants to share any other concerns they have, and discuss these as a group. But be careful not to get bogged down in overly philosophical or theoretical discussions - the point of the workshop is to make practical changes!
- Set only a certain amount of time for discussion, and make sure to move on afterward
- Offer to discuss lingering concerns with attendees after the workshop
- Remember, you don’t need to dispel all concerns - it’s ok to say you don’t know (but will look it up), or just acknowledge there are some risks/drawbacks
