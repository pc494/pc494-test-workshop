Much of the bulk of a workshop might be based on teaching participants how to write a useful, high-quality preregistration. It may be helpful to discuss as a group what makes a preregistration useful.

## Content you may want to cover
- Remember the ‘good-enough’ mindset -- a preregistration does not have to be perfect, and you will get better with practice.
- Use future tense (to indicate the study has not been run yet).
- Make sure hypotheses are clearly numbered and identified, so it is clear what is or isn’t a formal hypothesis, and analysis plans can refer back to particular hypotheses easily.
- Make sure methods are specified with enough detail that an inexperienced colleague could replicate them. There is no hard and fast rule what to include - important details may differ by field. Looking at examples, and/or doing the other exercises in section b, may help determine which details are important. Also, think about including contingencies for if things go wrong. As a basic guide, methods may include:
	- Sample size justification
	- Exclusion/inclusion criteria and contingencies for when to stop or restart data collection
	- How, exactly, will you measure your variables
	- Etc. (whatever else is relevant to your discipline)
- Make sure analyses/ statistical tests are specified with enough detail to be fully replicated (e.g., not just ‘we will run a t-test,’ but specify how many tails, what type of t-test, inclusion criteria for sample, etc.) - imagine giving this plan to someone with no knowledge of your study.
	- It may help to simulate data and run analyses on it, to anticipate problems with the analysis plan
	- Consider how to treat potential null results (e.g., equivalence testing)
- Make sure models/analyses are clearly linked to which hypotheses they are testing.

Overall the above principles boil down to making sure:
The study you are preregistering is well-designed
The prereg is clearly written and linked up
The prereg is specified in enough detail

## Teaching methods you may want to use
- Discuss as a group what makes a preregistration useful versus unhelpful
- Run an exercise using examples of bad (vague, disorganised, etc.) preregistrations and have participants identify the problems and improve them
- Go through [examples](https://osf.io/e6auq/wiki/Example%20Preregistrations/?view) of real preregistrations (and [papers](https://www.zotero.org/groups/479248/osf/collections/VKXUAZM7) reporting preregistered studies) in your field
- Have participants actually try their hand at writing a preregistration (a real, or toy example one)
- Peer review each other’s preregistrations in pairs or groups
