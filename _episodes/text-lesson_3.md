title: "Prereg: Tying the preregistration into the final manuscript"
teaching: 30
exercises: null
duration: null
summary: Understanding how to preregistration and final manuscript tie together
questions:
  - How do I link my manuscript back to my preregistration?
  - What happens if I make changes?
  - How do I differentiate between exploratory and confirmatory analyses?
objectives:
  - Understand how to link your manuscript back to your preregistration
  - Understand how to report changes transparently
  - Understand how to differentiate between different types of analyses in your
    manuscript
keypoints:
  - Different journals handle linking to preregistrations differently, so it's
    best to check relevant journals' policies
  - You can report changes between your preregistration and manuscript in a
    'transparent changes' section
  - You are use subheadings or explain in the text to differentiate between
    different types of analyses

Discuss how to write up/report your results after the study is run (see this [checklist](https://osf.io/zwkqj/)), including:
- How to link the manuscript back to the preregistration (journals differ in their conventions for tying preregistrations to the final manuscript, so you might want to give an example from a journal relevant to your attendees’ field)
- How to make any changes transparent (e.g., by including a ‘transparent changes’ section or supplement)
- How to differentiate between exploratory and confirmatory analyses (e.g., report them under separate sub-headings, and/or explain in the text)
