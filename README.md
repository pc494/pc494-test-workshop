# The UKRN Open Research Workshop Template

This repository is The [UKRN](https://ukrn.org/) template for creating websites for Open Research Training workshops.

The easiest way to use this repository is to use the [UKRN Workshop Builder](https://ukrn-wb.netlify.app/).
The Workshop Builder will walk you through constructing a workshop, allowing you to select and customise the lessons you include.
At the end, you will have a website you can use to deliver the workshop to your participants.

You can use this template to build an entirely customised workshop manually.
To do so, **please _do not fork this repository directly on GitHub._**
Instead, please use GitHub's "template" function to copy this `workshop-template` repository and customize it for your workshop.

## Acknowledgements

This repository is adapted from [The Carpentries' template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) for creating websites for workshops.
